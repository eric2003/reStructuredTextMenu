Enumerated Lists
=========================

Raw reStructuredText:
::

  1. This is the first item
  2. This is the second item
  3. Enumerators are arabic numbers,
     single letters, or roman numerals
  4. List items should be sequentially
     numbered, but need not start at 1
     (although not all formatters will
     honour the first index).
  #. This item is auto-enumerated
  
Typical result:  

1. This is the first item
2. This is the second item
3. Enumerators are arabic numbers,
   single letters, or roman numerals
4. List items should be sequentially
   numbered, but need not start at 1
